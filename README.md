Dental hygiene shop:
Small, proof-of-concept console application of a store selling dental hygiene products. The application can be accessed by users and by the admin. The admin can do CRUD operations on product data and on some of the users' data. The users can view, sort, filter products, add them to their cart and order them. The application offers the choice between an in-memory and a database repository. All changes made through CRUD operations and product orders are reflected in the repository used for the respective session (with the database repository storing the changes from one session to another). We have implemented the application using the MVC pattern.
